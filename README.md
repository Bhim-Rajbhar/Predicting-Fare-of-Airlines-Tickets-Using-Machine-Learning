Note :->>

We will solve most of those challenges that we often face in real world..
we will focus primarily on each & every part of data science life-cycle..

 Life- Cycle of Data Science Project :
    a) Data collection
    b) Perform Data Cleaning / Data Preparation / Data Pre-processing 
    c) Data visuaslisation(EDA)
    d) Perform feature engineering
        I)  Feature encoding
        II) checking outliers & impute it..
        III)Feature selection or feature importance
    e) build machine leaning model & dump it..
    f) Automate ML Pipeline 
    g) hypertune ml model..along with cross validation
